Thank you for stopping by! ‚ù§Ô∏è If you made it this far, you must have been curious. That is an excellent trait to have!

What is it all for‚ùì A question I finally answered for myself.

My name is Wayne Hattingh, four is a relevant number to me - so when it came time to name my little enterprise, whatt4 fell into place. 

Now, being is my primary focus, and I have always wanted a part of that to be online. It took me a while to build up enough courage to do so. Now I create, sometimes on my own, and sometimes with friends I have made along the way.

We've done a lot of really cool things and had a lot of fun - even though we are all pretty serious about our work. 

Want to get in touch and see what we are up to‚ùì Maybe collaborate‚ùì

Send me a message - click the small envelope at the bottom üì¨

Take it easy ‚úåÔ∏è
